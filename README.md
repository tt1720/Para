# Para
Para-Team 8 Submission- Antonia Fetzer, Cosmin Ichim, Shirley Xu, Taiga Takahashi
This project was developed for the AstraZeneca Neurodiversity Hackathon. 
Please download and access the Para shortcut. Alternatively, please use the exe in the bin>Release folder.
An additional program was made in Python in order to extract the keywords from a text. We planned on connecting it with a REST API but we did not have enough time. 
This keyword extraction program is planned to be part of the function that changes the color and font of key words to make it more visible, as you see in the app design in video.
An image was attached with the overall presentation.
